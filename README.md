Fake and Real News Text Classification using Deep Learning Techniques

Fake news refers to the deliberate presentation of false or misleading claims as news, where the claims are misleading by design.

The news media has evolved from newspapers, tabloids, and magazines to a digital form such as online news platforms, blogs, social media feeds, and many news mobile apps. News outlets have benefitted from the widespread use of social media/mobile platforms by providing updated news in near-real-time to their subscribers.

It has become easier for consumers to acquire the latest news at their fingertips. These digital media platforms have become very powerful due to their easy accessibility to the world and their ability to allow users to discuss and share ideas and debate over issues such as democracy, education, health, research, and history.

However, apart from its advantages, false/fake news articles on digital platforms are becoming very common and are mainly used with negative intent for their own benefit, such as political and financial gain, creating biased opinions, manipulating mindsets, and spreading absurdity.

With the rapid adoption of the internet, social media, and digital platforms (such as Facebook, Twitter, news portals, or any social media), anybody can spread untrue and biased information. It is virtually impossible to prevent fake news from being created. There has been a rapid increase in the spread of fake news in the last decade, and it's not limited to any one domain like politics but covers various other domains such as sports, health, history, entertainment, and even science and research.

If we take the example of the 2016 US presidential election, there were lots of biased and fake news published to influence. Another example could be of COVID-19, where we generally come across many misleading/fake news items every day which can have serious consequences and may lead to creating panic among people and spreading the pandemic more rapidly.

Therefore, it is important and absolutely necessary to identify and differentiate Fake News from real news. One of the ways to determine this is by expert fact-checking of every news item, but this is time-consuming and requires skills which cannot be shared. Second, we can automate the detection of Fake News by using the techniques of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

The online news content has diverse unstructured format data (such as documents, videos, and audios), but here we will concentrate on text format news. With the advancement of Natural Language Processing, it is now possible to identify the deceptive and fake nature of an article or sentence.

There is a widespread study and experimentation happening in this area to identify Fake news for all mediums (video, audio, and text) of news. In this study, real and fake news dataset was used to classify unreliable news articles as fake news using deep learning techniques such Transfer Learning using Pretrained Transformers model (BERT), Pretrained embeddings for GRU and Bidirectional LSTM models.
